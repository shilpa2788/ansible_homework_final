== Business Use Case

You are a consultant assigned to a telecommunications company called MitziCom. MitziCom provides hosting and cloud services to a variety of clients, from medium-sized companies to enterprise giants.

MitziCom has asked you to lead a 30- to 40-hour proof-of-concept (POC) using Red Hat Ansible Tower. The purpose of the POC is to determine the feasibility of using Ansible Tower as a CI/CD tool for automating continuous deployment of an internal three-tier application on QA and production environments. Note that this requires maintaining several instances of the application.


== Lab Envronment 

The lab details a recommended process for meeting MitziCom's requirements, as defined in the lab's goals. Information about the infrastructure, DNS names, passwords, and more is provided throughout the lab.

== Overview 

In this lab, you continue to develop your _good_ three-tier application playbooks from your pre-class assignment in Lab 00. FinanceTech is pleased with the initial work and wants to move forward with deploying Ansible Engine more widely. They
also see potential value in deploying Ansible Tower.

They want your good three-tier application playbooks to be used by internal teams as an internal _gold standard_, and to serve as an example for other teams to
help them adopt best practices, consistency, and reuse.

They ask you to make a final pass and refactor throughout the plays to make sure that they adhere to a very high standard. In particular, they want you to focus on the following:

* Using a clear and consistent style
* Making sure that plays and tasks are self-documenting, with clear and meaningful
names
* Making sure that the repositories are fully self-contained
** FinanceTech is adopting an _Infrastructure as Code_ policy going forward
* Using roles extensively to achieve a high degree of reuse and modularity
* Making sure that optimal modules are used throughout
* Use roles extensively throughout
* Use templates throughout, making sure they are clearly marked as "Ansible generated"
* Use handlers where appropriate
* Use Ansible Vault to protect sensitive information


=== Requirements

In this section you will develop playbooks to automate the process of installing isolated node, provision QA Env running on OSP, provision Prod env on AWS and deploy three tier application and run the smoke test.

. Clone the repo which will act as the skelton of the project.

==== QA Environment

* Ansible Playbooks are provided to provision network, security groups and keypairs on OpenStack.

. OpenStack Platform-hosted infrastructure using the network details provided below:
+

** link:http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/repo/internal.repo["http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/repo/internal.repo^"]

. Develop a task to run a smoke test on the QA environment for the three-tier application from Ansible Tower
. Develop a playbook to destroy the QA environment on OpenStack if the smoke test fails


=== Provision Production Environment

In this section, you write a playbook that uses the script to provision the production
environment on AWS.

* Prerequisite for the script that provisions the production environment:
+
[source,text]
----
mkdir ~/bin
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/common.sh
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/jq-linux64 -O ~/bin/jq
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/order_svc.sh
chmod +x order_svc.sh ~/bin/jq
----

* Steps to run the shell script to deploy the production environment from the bastion host:
+
[source,text]
----
cat << EOF > credential.rc
export username=<userid-companyname.com>
export password=<cf password>
export uri=https://labs.opentlc.com
EOF

source credential.rc ; ./order_svc.sh -c 'OPENTLC Automation' -i 'Three Tier Application' -t 1

----
+
[NOTE]
Non-Interactive: Use `-y` if you do not want to be prompted and you are sure you want to
continue.
